# Step 4: Adding Frida Kahlo - Add 3d models

You now have a face tracker that converts your face into a catrina! But let's give it a touch. Let's add a bit of Frida Kahlo's touch by adding flowers to your head

First we need to add the 3d model of flowers as assets in your project

Now we can attach two sets of flowers to your face tracking and we will adjust their location to look attached to your head.

Finally, let's resize the roses and move them closer to your head. This is tricky but here are the numbers you need to input.  You can also manually adjust them but it was quite hard.
